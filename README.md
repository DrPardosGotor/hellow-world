Passionate about SCREW THEORY for ROBOTICS.

The importance of screw theory in robotics is recognised but hardly capitalised on.
Engineering students rarely get to learn about it in class, so only few postgraduates know how to exploit it.
However, in a variety of areas of robotics, the methods and formalisms based on the geometry and algebra of the screws, 
have proven to be superior to other techniques.
